# Anomaly detection 

**Anomaly detection** is an interesting topic that is gaining interest in different industries. Anomaly detection algorithms in health care can point to health issues of patients and in the financial world, they can flag frauds. In this repository, I have added some of the commonly used methods in anomaly detection areas together with [youtube links](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaVmW8OFDuvD5-OJDmx3y_ju-h4bAQiUn) where I am explaining these methods in simple terms. Please feel free to text or comment anywhere you have questions.

## 1- Isolation forest: 
Is a tree based algorithm that tries to find how soon each point will be isolated if we grow the tree(s). This method first was introduced in 2008 and gained a lot of interest since then. Please watch my [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNDcPUeCEPI) regarding isolation forest [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNDcPUeCEPI)

## 2- K Nearest Neighbors (KNN): 
KNN is an algorithm that can be used in both supervised and unsupervised approachs. [In this video,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmttGrJs08) I am explaining how unsupervised KNN can be applied in anomaly detection problems [(click here for the video).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmttGrJs08)
